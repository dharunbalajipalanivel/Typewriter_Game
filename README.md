# Typewriter_Game
The Typewriter Game Applet is a simple Java applet that challenges players to type specific letters displayed on the screen within a limited time. The objective is to score points by correctly typing the target letter and achieving a high score before the timer runs out.

## How to Play

1. The applet displays a target alphabet that players need to type.

2. Quickly type the displayed alphabet in the input field.

3. If the typed letter matches the target alphabet, your score increases.

4. If you type the wrong letter or the timer runs out, the game ends.

5. You can restart the game to improve your high score.

## Installation and Running

1. Copy the Java code provided above into a `.java` file (e.g., `TypewriterGameApplet.java`).

2. Compile the Java file using a Java compiler. In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the `.java` file and run:

   ```bash
   javac TypewriterGameApplet.java
3. Open the compiled `.class` file using a web browser that supports Java applets. You can do this by running a simple web server in the same directory as the compiled `.class` file. For example, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server:

   ```bash
   python -m http.server
Then, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the appropriate address) to see the applet.

4. Follow the instructions displayed in the applet to play the game.
